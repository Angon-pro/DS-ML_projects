## CNN thermogram classifier
Description:
The CNN is projected as a fire-detection solution based on flight altitude obtained thermograms analysis. The model classifies a thermogram with values 0 (no fire) and 1 (fire). The reached accuracy of the network classification is about ~75%

	"CNN_thermogram_classifier" directory contains the .ipynb file and link to the dataset

Stack: Python, Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, Keras

## CNN MNIST classifier
Description:
The model identifies a digit on an input image using softmax output activation function. The accuracy of the CNN reaches about ~99%

	"CNN_MNIST_classifier" directory contains the .ipynb file
 	MNIST is imported from tensorflow.keras.datasets

Stack: Python, Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, Keras

## Logistic regression Titanic classifier
Description:
A model to predict either a Titanic passenger will survive or not based on their passenger class, sex, age, amount of sibligs, amount of children and ticket price. 
The solution uses the logistic regression method provided by Scikit-learn library. The reached accuracy is top 80%

	"Logistic_regression_Titanic_classifier" directory contains the .ipynb file and the dataset

Stack: Python, Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
